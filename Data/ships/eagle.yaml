name: Eagle
description: Sporting two hangars, a good set of turrets, a large forward 
	hardpoint, and ample space for cargo and support equipment, the Eagle is a 
	good all-arounder for doing missions in the harsh Olympian sky.
	
	The Eagle is the quintessential sky-captain's airship. Brought to Olympus 
	during the Third Wave, it takes the lessons of the previous colonists and 
	condensed them into a craft capable of facing the bulk of what Olympus can 
	throw at it. Almost all successful captains has had a stint on working on 
	or captaining one.
	
	It has since been superseded by newer, more capable models, but the Eagle 
	is still a popular choice for many captains in Olympus.
